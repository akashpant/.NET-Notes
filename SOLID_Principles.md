### SOLID Principles

The SOLID principle was introduced by <b>Robert C. Martin</b>, also known as Uncle Bob.(not king Bob !ðŸ˜‚)

#### S -> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
#### O -> Open/Closed Principle
#### L -> Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle (LSP)
#### I -> Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
#### D -> Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable.

S -> One class should have one purpose. \n
O -> Entities can be open for extension but closed for modification. \n
L -> Child class could be replaced in case of parent class.(parent - rectangle, child - rectangle with equal edges) \n
I -> Only required functionality of interface should be present in a class, interfaces should only have single purpose. \n
D -> High Level modules should not depened on low level modules, it makes it tightly coupled, tv remove is depenedent on battery but not on brand of battery. \n
