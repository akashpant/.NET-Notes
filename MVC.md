- MVC refers to the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, which is widely used for developing web applications.

- ASP.NET, MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

### Models:
1. Represent the application's data and business logic.
2. Define properties and methods that interact with data and perform business operations.
- Examples: Product model, Customer model, Order model.

### Views:
1. Responsible for presenting the UI to the user.
2. Typically written in Razor syntax, a combination of HTML and C# code.
3. Receive data from controllers and dynamically render it into HTML.
4. Can use layout templates, partial views, and view components for reusability and modularity.

### Controllers:
1. Handle incoming HTTP requests and decide what actions to take.
2. Interact with models to retrieve or update data.
3. Select and render appropriate views to display results.
4. Often contain logic for form processing, data validation, and user authentication.
5. Can leverage action filters for cross-cutting concerns like authorization and error handling.

### View Components:
1. Reusable UI elements that encapsulate a portion of a view.
2. Can be independently invoked and rendered within views or other view components.
3. Promote code reusability and maintainability.
Examples: Product card, Pagination control, Search box.

### Areas:
1. Used to organize large applications into smaller, modular sections.
2. Each area has its own controllers, views, models, and other components.
3. Useful for grouping related functionality and managing complexity.

### Filters:
1. Allow you to intercept and modify request and response processing.
2. Can be used for tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, caching, and custom actions.
3. Examples: Action filters, Result filters, Exception filters.

### Tag Helpers:
1. Simplify the creation of custom HTML elements and attributes in Razor views.
2. Reduce the need for inline C# code within views.
3. Examples: Form tag helper, Anchor tag helper, Validation tag helpers.

### Dependency Injection:
1. Built-in mechanism for managing object creation and dependencies.
2. Promotes loose coupling and testability.
3. Allows components to request dependencies without knowing their concrete implementations.

### Routing:
1. Maps incoming URL requests to specific controller actions.
2. Provides flexibility in defining URL patterns and parameters.
3. Supports attribute-based routing for cleaner code.

### Model Binding:
1. Automatically maps data from HTTP requests to model properties.
2. Handles form submissions and query string parameters.
3. Validates user input and provides error handling mechanisms.

### Templating:
1. Razor templating engine for combining HTML with C# code.
2. Dynamically generates HTML content based on data and logic.
3. Supports conditional statements, loops, and code blocks.
