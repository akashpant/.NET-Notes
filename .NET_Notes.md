### Notes
The .NET Framework is a software development framework developed by Microsoft that provides a runtime environment and a set of libraries and tools for building and running applications on Windows operating systems. it supports a range of application types, including desktop, web, mobile, and gaming applications.

- The .NET Framework includes two main components: the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework Class Library.’

- The CLR is responsible for managing the execution of code written in any of the supported languages, while the class library provides a large set of pre-built functions and classes that can be used to create a wide range of applications.

One of the key advantages of the .NET Framework is its support for a variety of programming languages.developers can choose the language that best fits their needs and expertise, while still being able to use the same set of libraries and tools provided by the framework.

Another advantage of the .NET Framework is its support for a variety of application types. The framework includes libraries and tools for creating desktop, web, mobile, and gaming applications

The .NET Framework also provides a number of features that help improve the security, reliability, and performance of applications. These include features such as code access security, automatic memory management, and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which helps improve the speed of application execution.

The .NET Framework is also designed to integrate with other Microsoft technologies, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Office.

The first version of the .Net framework was 1.0 which came in the year 2002.
It is used to develop Form-based applications, Web-based applications, and Web services.

#### Main Components of .NET Framework
##### Common Language Runtime(CLR):
CLR is the basic and Virtual Machine component of the .NET Framework. It is the run-time environment in the .NET Framework that runs the codes and helps in making the development process easier by providing various services such as remoting, thread management, type safety, memory management, robustness, etc. 
 It also helps in the management of code, as code that targets the runtime is known as Managed Code, and code that doesn’t target to runtime is known as Unmanaged code. 
##### Framework Class Library(FCL):
It is the collection of reusable, object-oriented class libraries and methods, etc that can be integrated with CLR. Also called the Assemblies.

Is the .NET application platform dependent or platform independent?
The combination of Operating System Architecture and CPU Architecture is known as the platform. Platform-dependent means the programming language code will run only on a particular Operating System.
 A .NET application is platform-dependent because of the .NET framework which is only able to run on the Windows-based operating system.
However using the Mono, Mono framework the .Net application can run on any Operating System including windows. Mono framework is a third-party software developed by Novell Company which is now a part of Micro Focus Company. It is a paid framework. 

##### Advantages of .NET Framework:
Multi-language support
Cross-platform compatibility
Large community
Security
Productivity
Disadvantages of .NET Framework:
Windows dependency
Large footprint: The .NET Framework has a large installation footprint, which can make it difficult to deploy applications on systems with limited storage or bandwidth.
Licensing: Some versions of the .NET Framework require a license, which can add to the cost of developing and deploying applications.
Performance
Learning curve
